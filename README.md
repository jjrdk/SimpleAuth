# Simple Auth

A minimalist take on the [SimpleIdentityServer](https://github.com/thabart/SimpleIdentityServer) project.

The project runs under .NET core 2.1.

Supports OpenID Connect, OAuth2 and UMA standards.

Most features have been merged into the simpleauth project.

All EntityFramework dependencies have been stripped away. It is up to you to provide your own implementation of repositories.
